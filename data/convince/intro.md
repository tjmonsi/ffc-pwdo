## We know you love good design & good code.

You’re probably building something awesome at your desk right now — chained to it like a creative genius.

However, face time with like-minded colleagues also matters. Studies indicate that networking and being in open networks of contacts is one indicator of success. Attending events such as conferences not only connects you with potential collaborators, clients, and friends, but also helps you connect the dots creatively. Get inspired and all fired up to make beautiful, well-designed sites, apps, interfaces, digital products and experiences!

We created Form Function & Class because we recognize this need — to go beyond what you can learn online and experience actual learning in a conference setting.

At FFC, you’ll learn case studies, best practices, and solutions while interacting with your peers and colleagues. Everything you can take home from the conference will help you effectively meet and overcome the biggest web design challenges you are facing today!

Form Function & Class is the main event of the Philippine Web Designers Organization: a grassroots, volunteer-run, non-profit organization that helps develop the local community by championing professionalism & excellence in crafting interfaces for the Web.

In 2015, we had the amazing Rachel Nabors, Holger Bartel, James Cabrera, Angela Salud Chua, Angela Obias, and Brad Frost.

In 2016, we heard excellent talks from Sam Chan, Kendra Schaefer, Lester Cruz, Mika Aldaba, Chris Lienert, and Sacha Greif.

In 2017, we got amazing insight from Russell Vergara, Aceler Chua, Hui Jing Chen, Madhuara Chavan, Angela & B Tuban, John Paul de Guzman, Lindsey & Gab Madrid, and Chris Lienert.

Although we have limited resources, we work hard so you can learn from the brightest minds in the Philippines, Asia, and the rest of the world, improve your craft, and get ahead in your career.

All pumped to attend FFC? Great!
