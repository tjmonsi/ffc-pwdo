Description: With HTTP/2, Service Workers, Progressive Web Apps, Responsive Images, Flexbox, CSS Grid Layout, SVG, WAI-ARIA roles and Font Loading API now available in browsers, we all are still trying to figure out just the right strategy for designing and buildings responsive websites efficiently. We want to use all of these technologies and smart processes like atomic design, but how can we use them efficiently, and how do we achieve it within a reasonable amount of time?

Expectation: In this workshop, Vitaly Friedman, editor-in-chief of Smashing Magazine, will be looking into a strategy for crafting fast, resilient and flexible responsive design systems by utilizing all of those wonderful shiny web technologies we have available today. We'll also talk about dealing with legacy browsers and will cover a few dirty little techniques that might ensure that your responsive websites will stay relevant, flexible and accessible in the years to come. Beware: you won’t be able to unlearn the things that you’ll learn in the workshop!

Outline:
- architecting and building pattern libraries and design systems
- content choreography, internationalization and localization issues
- layout techniques (Flexbox and CSS Grid)
- resolution independence (SVG Gotchas)
- compressive images (optimization and techniques)
- responsive images (technical perspective)
- dealing with web fonts (options, strategy, code snippets)
- deferring and lazy-loading JavaScript (techniques, tools)
- performance issues/strategy (best practices + HTTP/2 + HTTPS + prefetching techniques)
- transition from HTTP to HTTPS
- maintenance issues (e.g. dealing with legacy browsers)
- progressive web apps and offline functionality
- service workers and implication on design and development
- common front-end challenges and solutions
- accessibility issues and techniques
- responsive HTML email newsletters
- tooling (performance, frameworks, testing, quality assurance)
