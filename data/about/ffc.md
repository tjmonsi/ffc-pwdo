As the <a href="https://pwdo.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philippine Web Designers Organization</a> commemorates its 10th anniversary this 2018, &lt;form&gt; function() & .class celebrates its 9th year!

What you might not know is: we formed the organization because we wanted to hold a web design conference in the Philippines.

We knew that putting the event together would take a while, so we began with a MiniFFC meetup on October 30, 2008 at the G2VC TechBar in Exist, Pasig. Over 50 people listed to 6 wonderful talks — a mini conference, indeed. Then on July 10, 2009 we launched the first FFC at the Asian Institute of Management Makati.
Over the years we’ve introduced workshops and masterclasses to FFC, and this year we’re doing something different once again: an all-masterclass format.

Our events may shift in form, buzzwords might come and go—much like the dynamic nature of this industry—but our goals remain: to unite professionals & enthusiasts who create human interfaces for the Web, to champion the use of standards, accessibility, & usability, and to uplift the state of web design in the country.

Why is it called FFC? The 3 words allude to the 3 elements of a website (&lt;form&gt; from HTML, function() from JavaScript, .class from CSS) and to 3 concepts central to the craft—form, function, & continuous learning.
