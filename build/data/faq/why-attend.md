##### Why should I attend FFC?

You’ll hear from amazing speakers who are the best in the business. Not only are they updated with what’s new in the industry, they’re the trailblazers and innovators themselves–and they’re sharing their wealth of knowledge with you! Every year, we get attendees coming up to us & telling us that they’re on information overload and that they wouldn’t have known about the new technologies available to them if they hadn’t attended the FFC conference. That’s what we want: to nudge our attendees in the right direction so they remain globally competitive in an industry that’s incredibly fast paced.
