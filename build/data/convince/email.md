    Dear Sir / Ma’am,
  </p>

  <p>
    Our company has always been committed to creating amazing digital products for our customers and stakeholders. In line with our commitment, I’d like to inform you about an upcoming conference that will be of value to us.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Philippine Web Designers Organization (a grassroots web design community known for bringing in talented international design speakers) has organized a conference on web design called Form Function & Class. I believe we should join this conference for the following reasons:
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ll hear from amazing speakers who are the best in the business. Not only are they updated with what’s new in the industry, they’re the trailblazers and innovators themselves—and they’re sharing their wealth of knowledge with us, here in Manila!
  </p>

  <p>
    PWDO, the organization itself, is a major community player that conducts regular meet-ups on design & development topics in schools and in different organizations. They are a non-profit organization. Joining the event supports the local design community that provides our company the manpower pool we would need in the future.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most conferences in other countries cost $500–1000. This event will held here in Manila for less than $100. For the quality of talks & speakers, it’s the best deal we will get in the Asian region!
  </p>

  <p>
    Joining FFC allows us to learn the latest ideas & trends, and see what others are doing in the market. We only get this kind of opportunity with such top-notch international speakers once in a lifetime. We should take advantage of it. The earlier we register, the bigger the discount we can get on our registration!

    Sincerely,<br>
    Your Creative Web Designer
